# Rock Browser
### Good, fast, simple browser, secure aswhile, does not use chromium unlike EVERY browser nowadays.

Ever just wanted a simple browser that doesn't steal all your data, something that doesn't have 38 Million lines of code *cough cough* chromium *cough cough*

## Indroducing Rock Browser

A simple, open source, browser, allowing you to be on the web without worrying about chromirat.
Ask anyone, Chromium does track you, but I decided, "hey, lemme just get rid of that"



## Q&A

Q: Is this vibe coded
A: The actual browsing part, no, the back end is all me, but with SOME theming Claude Code did help me out.

Q: What makes this secure
A: The "backend" is coded custom by me, not ripped by chromium and their trackers on that.

Q: What operating system does Rock Browser support?
A: Untill full release sadly only Windows, then we will expand to iOS & Linux

Q: Do I need to install anything else to use it?
A: Only "rock browsing.exe", the source code is also avaiable to use 

Q: Is my browsing history saved?
A: Nope, another reason we are one of the (if not) safest browsers on the planet.

Q: Can I change the default search engine?
A: Sadly untill a later beta release no, I am currently looking into making my own to ensure maximum security, currectly DuckDuckGo seems like the safest option.

Q: How do I report a bug?
A: Open a issue in GitHub and I will fix it as soon as possible.

Q; How do I suggest a feature?
A: Please open a issue, we will have a email later on for contact purposes.
